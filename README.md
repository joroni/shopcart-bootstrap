# Javascript Challenge

Included in this repository is a blank HTML template containing the list of items stored in the *info* variable. This is a sample data that you might get when you are requesting data from a REST API endpoint.

Using the provided HTML file, please create a mobile web prototype following the wireframe (wireframe.png). 

### Regarding the Wireframe:
Please note that this is just a "wireframe" and we would expect you to apply some usable designs. 
You are free to create your own design or apply existing design/frameworks (Bootstrap, Foundation, and Material UI)

## Requirements:
* HTML5 and CSS3 required.
* Items should be dynamically added when the page loads.
* Please use Javascript only. We can reconsider jQuery... no other frameworks (ReactJS, AngularJS, Vue.js, etc...)

## Please answer the following questions:
* Please explain how did you come up with the solution. We would like to see your train of thought.

I would agree on the usage of the "old school" Javascript due to its cross framework compatibility. In respect as the poineer language of all the new (show-off) framework comming out. Overall, in my opnion this is one of the most simpliest approach to meet the requirements. Reason is, to make the code easy for a team of developers to work on.


* Please explain any design decisions made (why you chose the design/framework, etc.)

- I came to a slick design of the store front, with color scheme and the strong personification of your company logo, I believe a clean UI and minimalistic approach will give more legitimacy of the app.

- I'm a fan of Framework and Ionic, but due to the requirements, Boostrap is my next suggested framework/library. I preferred using plain Javascript on this one, and I took the opportunity to jQuery functions to give reinforcements to the operation for web app to work to it's most practical speed and user experience. 

* Please indicate tools that you used for coming up with your solution.

During development and testing, I just used Visual Studio Code and  Phonegap CLI setup.

I just Run the app  via Visual Studio's Integrated Terminal and just run the code

$ phonegap serve


* Choose one: Star Wars or Star Trek? Why?

Starwars for me, because of its overall effect to all generations either young ones and adults that could related into. And I believe it can make money a lot than Star Trek because of its marketing power.
